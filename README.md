# Password Generator & Manager

A simple command-line password manager that helps you generate secure-ish passwords.

## Description

This Python-based password manager is an easy way to create passwords with different character combinations. Generated passwords can be saved along with their website/app names and usernames for future reference.

# Security Note

This project was just me messing around in Python. Passwords are stored in a local text file. It's not secure, so consider implementing encryption for stored passwords.
